 abstract = {As we’re driving around Chicago going about our weekly business, we can’t help but notice telltale signs of social problems in our neighborhoods, such as homelessness, drug use, street prostitution, and suspected human trafficking. Some neighborhoods are frozen in time, often with little evidence of new development and access to opportunities that are clustered around the north side of Chicago. It may not be comfortable for us to intervene directly or scientifically sound to draw conclusions based on our isolated observations. Nevertheless, we may have an opportunity to contribute as citizen scientists by recording our observations and sharing them with better-equipped stakeholders.

The interdisciplinary DriveAware project aims to use mobile computing technology to make it safe and convenient for citizen scientists in their vehicles or on foot to augment existing observations, e.g. Google Street View, such as geotagged annotated images, to various stakeholders, such as social scientists, law enforcement, social service providers, and ordinary fellow citizens. The collected data can be used in various ways, including offline data analysis and real-time maps and dashboards, as well as concrete action, such as social scientists going on location to interview the affected individuals, law enforcement investigating and prosecuting potential incidents, and social service providers intervening directly, e.g., by picking up homeless persons during a cold spell and taking them to shelters.

In addition to the interdisciplinary stakeholders’ existing research questions, this project gives rise to various computer science research questions, such as system requirements and architecture, system implementation, integration with existing databases in particular fields, user experience studies to determine the likelihood of reporting observations through in-car voice-based and/or reduced distraction touch interfaces (Android Auto/Apple CarPlay) versus conventional mobile apps.

To support our research questions, we have developed a proof of concept of a mobile application for reporting observations in various pertinent categories, which get stored in a cloud-hosted Firebase (NoSQL) instance and can be accessed through a Python Jupyter notebook and analyzed/visualized in multidimensional ways.  Future plans include integration with commercial automotive frameworks, such as  Android Auto (and eventually Apple CarPlay) and automatic image collection from dashcams connected to the mobile phone via Bluetooth. The diagram below illustrates the high-level system architecture.},
