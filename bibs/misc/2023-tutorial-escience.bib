  abstract = {One of the key goals in high-performance and distributed software engineering is to leverage the specific capabilities of the target hardware to the extent possible. Today’s systems are typically heterogeneous, where one or more architectures may be present within a single system, such as conventional CPU cores combined with accelerators such as GPUs and FPGAs. Although parallel computing itself has reached a high level of maturity, as we move toward exascale and beyond computing, challenges similar to those that plagued the earliest days of parallel and distributed computing are beginning to resurface: Leveraging heterogeneity while balancing performance, software portability, and developer productivity (P3). This tutorial provides hands-on experience in developing high-performance and embedded software for heterogeneous architectures using Intel’s oneAPI reference implementation of the Khronos SYCL standard in conjunction with state-of-the-art software engineering methods. By raising the abstraction level via its unified application programming interface (API), oneAPI makes it easier to develop portable high-performance software for systems with embedded hardware accelerators, such as GPUs and FPGAs.},
