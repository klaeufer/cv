% TODO advising
%
% Evaluation criteria
% Evidence of advising effectiveness may include 
% - information about undergraduate and/or graduate advising, as well as 
% - involvement in student professional development, counseling, and extracurricular activities. 
%
% Undergraduate and graduate advising I have participated in undergraduate and graduate advising since these responsibilities were divided among all computer science faculty in 2000 for undergraduates and 1999 for graduates. I have made it a point to be highly available to my advisees in person, by phone, and through suitable electronic channels. I am also happy to counsel other students who approach me for advice.
% Employment reference I regularly serve as a reference in support of our students' applications for employment in a variety of settings, including private companies, educational organizations, other nonprofit organizations, government agencies, etc.
% Reference for applications to graduate and professional programs I frequently serve as a reference in support of our students' applications for graduate or professional studies, including MBA programs, Law School, and Medical School.
